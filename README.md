No, the repo isn't offline ya silly goose! This is a game called "Offline".

If you've ever played Emily is Away, that was kind-of my inspiration for my game.
My game is very similar, just it allows you to talk to many people, not just 1 person. Oh, and the plot is a lot more extensive.

I don't recommend you look at any of the files that have the word "Plot" in the title, unless you don't actually plan on playing the game because those files will spoil EVERYTHING.

I'm kind of sad, and the reason for me being sad is that I have to spoil the plot to myself. Yay.

If you have any issues with the game, please state what version it is. Also, if it has UNFINISHED in the title, it probably means it's unfinished.

And with that, I hope you enjoy.

PS: I USED THINGS FROM OTHER SOURCES AND I HAVEN"T WRITTEN THE CREDITS SO PLEASE DONT SUE ME I STILL NEED TO GET THOSE DONE LMAO
